					<p>OpenBooks is an online portal created to simulate the web-browsing experience of the 1990s. It features articles, blogs, images, and more. OpenBooks was created on September 12th, 2014.</p>
					<h2>History of ChomeBooks</h2>
					<p>OpenBooks was created in September 2014, and was updated throughout the rest of the month. It was developed using Adobe Dreamweaver CS5. The website didn't receive many updates for a while, but other sites were made such as the <a href="http://networkneighborhood.neocities.org">Network Neighborhood<img src="img/shortcut.gif" alt="External Link" /></a> and the Neocities search engine, <a href="http://vhs.neocities.org">VHSearch<img src="img/shortcut.gif" alt="External Link" /></a>.</p>
					<p>The site was updated again in June 2015 with an updated, darker design when compared to the original.</p>
					<p>On September 27th 2015, a few weeks after the 1 year anniversary of OpenBooks, the site was mysteriously taken down for maintenance. During this time, the site was completely redesigned using Visual Studio Code, and all the code was rewritten by hand in order to clean up the mess left behind by Dreamweaver.</p>
					<p>OpenBooks 2.0 was launched on October 9th, 2015 with a more unified idea of what OpenBooks should be - an online portal to Neocities.</p>

				 	<p>Hi! My name is Marin. I made this website.</p>
					<p>You can contact me on AIM or by emailing me: <a href="mailto:chromebooks@aol.com" >chromebooks@aol.com<img src="img/mail.gif" alt="Mail Link" /></a></p>
					<p>I'm currently a senior in high school, and I make websites like this in my free time. As much as I enjoy vintage technology, as you can see by this website, I also have an interest in the latest tech.</p>
					<p>I developed this website using a 2011 iMac and Visual Studio Code. When I'm away from the desk I use a Samsung ChromeBook and a Microsoft Surface Pro 3.</p>
					<p>Sorry for not updating the site in a while. School happened. Oops.</p>
