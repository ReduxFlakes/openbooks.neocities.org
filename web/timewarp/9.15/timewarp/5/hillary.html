            <h5 class="grey">This page was going to be about Bernie Sanders, but...</h5>
            <p class="copy">This isn't the kind of thing I'd normally post on OpenBooks, but elections are coming soon and the continued support for Donald Trump makes me increasingly nervous.</p>
            <p class="copy"><a href="https://shift.newco.co/an-open-letter-from-technology-sector-leaders-on-donald-trumps-candidacy-for-president-5bf734c159e4#.f3h3drjlt" target="_blank">An open letter from technology sector leaders on Donald Trump's candidacy for president.</a></p>
            <p class="copy">I highly recommend reading this, which I believe thoroughly explains why no one in the technoogy sector should even consider voting for Trump. I'm not really advocating for Clinton either, but she's the only other option we have. I had hoped I'd be making this page about Bernie Sanders, but I'll make do with what life has given us.</p>
            <blockquote>Trump would be a disaster for innovation. His vision stands against the open exchange of ideas, free movement of people, and productive engagement with the outside world that is critical to our economy — and that provide the foundation for innovation and growth.</blockquote>
            <p>An excerpt from the open letter.</p>

            <blockquote>Donald Trump ... traffics in ethnic and racial stereotypes, repeatedly insults women, and is openly hostile to immigration.</blockquote>
            <p class="copy">America is built on immigrants and people of diverse backgrounds. Trump's running mate, Mike Pence, has inhibited the rights of LGBTQ+ people numerous times. As a transgender woman in America, a Trump administration is something I fear.</p>


            <p>Thank you. Pleae vote for Hillary Clinton this November.</p>

            <p>Also, to those of you who, like me, wouldn't normally support Hillary Clinton and are considering not voting at all: Please vote. The risk of having Trump presidency is too great to let it happen easily.</p>
