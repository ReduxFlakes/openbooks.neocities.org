					<p>i want to go somewhere i've never been to be with you</p>
					<p>when we had much younger faces</p>
					<p>we were saving up for something new</p>
					<p>i wish i could stay back then. the memories are much brighter.</p>
					<p>how long will i wait in vain for you</p>
					<p>i could right novels of words i'd wish i'd said to you, and still have some left over.</p>
					<p>i'm sorry.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>(god i don't know why i'm writing all of this or even publishing it publicly but here's some rambles and thoughts. until next time, take care.)</p>

					<p>isn't it weird seeing this design again? it's like i've gone back to my roots or something. or maybe i just wanted something easier to edit. probably that. anyway, i'm back to working on neocities things again, as you can see. as well a a little bit of trying to prove i still know how to do this. oh and i changed names again bc lol indecisiveness.</p>
