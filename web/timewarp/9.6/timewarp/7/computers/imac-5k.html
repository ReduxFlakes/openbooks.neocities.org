<h1>iMac Core i5/3.2 (Retina 5K, 27-inch, Late 2015)</h1>
<p><a href="img/imac-5k.JPG"><img src="img/imac-5k.JPG" width="100%"/></a></p>
<p>My precious - most of my work gets done on this machine. The display is absolutely amazing. The little orange thing under the display is my Thunderbolt hard drive, and yes, I use both the trackpad and the mouse. I can't work with just one of them. :p</p>
<p>I honestly wasn't a fan of the slim-design iMacs (2012+) until the 5k/4k displays. It's one of the few reasons to get one - a maxed out 2011 iMac can be much faster (which is what I had before this one) and the 2011s are much easier to work on - the glass is just held in by magnets. The newer ones have the glass glued in, so it's nearly impossible to remove without breaking something. But it's such a nice displa that it made it worth it for me. I got mine Apple refurbished and bought second hand, so I didn't pay too much for it. It also originally had display burn-in (a common issue on these LG displays) but was replaced by Apple with a new panel.</p>
<p>Purchased in 2017.</p>

<p>Not including photos for this one because it's literally the current model - Apple's site has photos better than any I could take.</p>
