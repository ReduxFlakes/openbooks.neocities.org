                        <h2>The OpenBooks WebRing</h2>
                        <h3>June 8, 2021</h3>
                        <p id="copy">The official OpenBooks WebRing is now available from the main page. This is the final successor to the original Network Neighborhood, and its attempts at revival, network2.</p>
                        <p id="copy">This is actually the first time I have made a proper webring - prior 'networks' weren't true webrings, like most of the ones you see on Neocities today. So why make one now, if there are already so many?</p>
                        <p id="copy">OpenBooks, and its sister site, VHSearch, are still visible on the Neocities home page. I want to use that opportunity to showcase other sites - and a webring and Discord community seem like the best way to do this, as well as promote the idea of personal static web pages into the next decade. Another webring just means more choices - more people - more static sites. All of which I think are good for the future of the personal web.</p>
                        <p id="copy">Right now, the 'Ring is still quite basic - the only sites in it are my own. You can join the Discord however, and ask to join it there. I'll update the code and send you a JS snippet to add to your site. I will also be updating the page on OpenBooks to showcase each site in the ring, with a personalized description and screenshot. Your site doesn't even have to be on Neocities, it just has to be a static website. </p>
                        <p id="copy">I hope you're as excited as I am about this new webring.</p>
                        <p id="copy">Thanks, <a href="https://twitter.com/iammerewife">Coyote Reyne</a></p>

                        <h2>Welcome to OpenBooks 9 Series.</h2>
                        <h3>May 13, 2021</h3>
                        <p id="copy">The next major revision of OpenBooks is here, featuring a complete redesign.</p>
                        <p id="copy">OpenBooks 9 puts a focus back on personal pages, starting with an all-new home page with easier access, and room to add more personalized content in the future. I will be adding 'microsites' for other projects I'm working on, in addition to the one personal microsite which is currently live.</p>
                        <p id="copy">There is also now a page for our Discord server, in preparation of the launch of OpenBooks' first true webring, as well a new links page featuring my favorite places on the web and Neocities.</p>
                        <p id="copy">I hope you enjoy browsing this website as much as I enjoy making it.</p>

                        <h2>OpenBooks in 2021</h2>
                        <h3>May 1, 2021</h3>
                        <p id="copy">I have a lot of changes planned for OpenBooks in the near to far future. OpenBooks will no longer attempt to be some kind of 'grand web portal', which, to be honest, it never really succeeded at. Uploading the archive of this site back to 2014 has inspired me, but this site is going to focus far more on things that personally interest me.</p>
                        <p id="copy">For now, I've started by tweaking the home page design, and pushing out some general improvements to the site, such as updating all pages to be the same width (instead of the current mis-match of page designs dating back to 8.0 in 2019) so things will feel a bit more consistent.</p>
                        <p id="copy">I've kept a version numbering system for most of OpenBooks' history, and the current version is the 8th major iteration. OpenBooks 8 Series, as it is known, will continue for a while, as new features and pages are added. However, I am planning a redesign for OpenBooks 9, though, I think it might be funny if I skip to 10 like Microsoft did. This redesign will keep the same general look and feel, like how OpenBooks 2 and 3 are basically the same, but with different CSS on top. However, OpenBooks 9 will differ by having a fully mobile-compatible design, something I learned how to do since I stopped updating OpenBooks in 2019 and worked on my personal sites (formerly Utsurundesu, and my current portfolio site.)</p>
                        <p id="copy">I also have a Discord server again, you can find it linked on the home page.</p>

                        <p>Oh, one more thing. Network2 isn't quite dead yet.</p>

                        <h2>The Future of OpenBooks and network2</h2>
                        <h3>June 16, 2019</h3>
                        <p id="copy">Today, we launched the first major update to OpenBooks, which refines the design direction we're moving in and introduces the Articles feature. Last month, Network2 announced its return to Neocities. As OpenBooks is one of the founders of Network2, we thought it was worth letting the public know a little bit of what we have in store.</p>
                        <p id="copy">From this point, OpenBooks is going to be Network2's brand for Neocities community services - such as search engines, portals, and directories. What does this mean for you? Honestly, not very much will change visibly.</p>
                        <p id="copy">We're also working behind the scenes to create Network2's website, as the current design is just a placeholder. Once that is done, we'll be ready to start accepting members and working on projects together.</p>
                        <p id="copy">That's all for this rather short update. Thank you for welcoming OpenBooks back into the Neocities commuity and for all of your feedback!</p>
                        <hr />

                        <h2>Welcome to OpenBooks 8 Series</h2>
                        <h3>May 12, 2019</h3>
                        <p id="copy">It's been a long time. How have you been? After taking quite a break from Neocities, I've finally decided to relaunch OpenBooks as something more akin to what I always wanted it to be. I'm a little late, I've been teasing the fact I've wanted to do this throughout all of 2018, but here in May 2019 the project has finally been ready to reveal. </p>
                        <p id="copy">So what is OpenBooks 8 Series, anyway? My goal for the site is to create a sort of community hub for Neocities. OpenBooks will offer basic services that help tie the Neocities community closer together. For now, that means we have a search engine and a basic web directory, which mostly links to external sites and not yet Neocities. I have more features planned, but they're a little more ambitious and I didn't want to hold off on getting the new OpenBooks out there any later.</p>
                        <p id="copy">So, this is version 8 of OpenBooks. If you've lost count, here's a little guide before the complete history page is ready. OpenBooks launched under the name ChromeBooks in 2014. Version 2.0 launched in 2015 and with version 2.4 the name was officially changed to OpenBooks and was released under an open source license. (OpenBooks remains open source, but is now licensed under the Creative Commons BY-SA 4.0 license). Versions 3 and 4 continued to be based off of the same codebase as 2.0, but all of that changed with version 5, in 2016. Version 5 stripped away the personal aspects of the site and focused primarily on the site's Neocities directory. I look back on the design of this version with appreciation, but also regret for how it removed the community aspects. Version 6 came and went, and was a personal site only. There were a few more personal page designs, but for the sake of continuity we're considering them part of OpenBooks 6. With 7.0, I tried to reconnect with the past and based the site off of 2.2, but this was rather short lived and the site has mostly just been a holding page since then. Now we've reached 8.0, officially named OpenBooks 8 Series. Here's hoping for a long and successful future on Neocities.</p>
