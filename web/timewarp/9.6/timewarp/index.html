                        <p id="copy">OpenBooks 8 Series is built on top of OpenBooks 5, however it is visually different. The original versions of OpenBooks 8 were inspired by Windows Live circa 2006/2007, and Windows Vista. 8.7 introduced the blue Media Center inspired color scheme still used today. OpenBooks 8 Series marked a return to OpenBooks being a Neocities hub and not just a personal site. Development stopped in mid 2019, and resumed in early 2021.</p>
                        <p id="copy">OpenBooks 9 Series builds on top of 8, further refining the visual style and cleaning up some of the leftover code from 2019, and rebuilds several core functions of the site while still showing similarities to 8.7.</p>
                        <p id="copy">9.5 introduced a new home page design, making the tiles from 9.0 more central to the design, and OpenBooks 9.6 introduced new page layouts like this one, made with a more universal CSS UI kit, making future page additions and modifications easier than before.</p>

Though this version had its own numbering scheme (it refers to itself as 1.3), it can be counted as the 6th major version of OpenBooks.</p>

                        <p id="copy">OpenBooks 5 was an attempt at a fully modern website - however it was met with harsh backlash over the Neocities userbase at the time. If posted today, OpenBooks 5 probably wouldn't be received as poorly. It was a complete redesign from the ground up, and parts of it even formed the later OpenBooks 8 Series.</p>
                        <p id="copy">5's stark white and teal minimalism was taken as an affront to the Neocities community - which was entirely based on 90s throwback websites at the time.</p>
