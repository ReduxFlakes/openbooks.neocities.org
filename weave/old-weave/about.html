      <h2>About</h2>
      <h3 class="subtitle">About Weave.css</h3>
      <p>Weave.css started as a template for Exley.xyz's own sites, designed to be as lightweight and as easy to use as possible, while still looking like a modern, responsive website. Since then, Weave.css has become a publicly available, open source project that anyone can use and edit for their own web design.</p>
      <p>Weave.css is meant to be as easily customizable as possible, using cutting edge CSS technology such as variables, which allows for customization without Less or Sass comiling an entire framework, most of which you may not even use.</p>
      <h3 class="subtitle">About Exley.xyz</h3>
