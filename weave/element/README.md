# Element CSS

Saner defaults for HTML elements.

Element is a CSS design / framework that only requires simple HTML elements for building a site. In contrast to most design frameworks that use a lot of nested `<div>` elements and inline classes, Element does away with that, making it quicker and easier to create decent-looking static web sites from scratch that are easy to edit and manage with just a text editor.

Think of it as a "Markdown for HTML", or "saner defaults for HTML elements".
