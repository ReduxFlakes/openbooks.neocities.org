# OpenBooks Manifesto

The purpose of the Manifesto is to establish OpenBooks' reason for existence, its purpose, goals, and a call-to-action for the citizens of the internet to take back the web, using technology that is freely accessible and free of capitalists' oversight.

1. OpenBooks exists to serve the community of personal websites, by providing: services that are useful to the community (search engine, directory, user submitted content), and by our own site being 100% open source for anyone to use as a basis to start their own website.

2. OpenBooks provides an example of a modern and accessible website, viewable in any browser or on any device without compromise. It is built as a completely static site, with no server-side code, content generators, or complicated CMS.

3. The personal, open web, does not coincide with nostalgia. We are not building websites because it reflects the old web we grew up with. We are building new, personal sites because it is the future. We are not reliving the old web, we are creating a new one, and taking it back from corporations and social networks. Some of us just miss the aesthetics.

4. We build using free and freely accessible technologies. There are no paywalls, no blockchain, no crypto, and no barrier to entry. Sites should be designed for any user to have access, freely, from whatever device they're using.

We are not reliving the past. We are not clinging to Web 1.0 nor are we luddites eschewing modern technologies. We invent our own, and create a new web controlled by those who make it, rather than it being governed by corporations, social networks, and algorithms.

We are taking back the web, and it is free for all to take part in.
