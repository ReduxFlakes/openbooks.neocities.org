            <h4>Neocities' most popular web portal. Finely tuned.</h4>
            <h3>Clear, concise, and focused. </h3>
            <p>OpenBooks started as the personal site of Marin Exley in 2014, under the name ChromeBooks. In 2015, VHSearch was launched, which was the precursor to today's OpenBooks. In 2016, the site was updated numerous times, and the name was changed. Since then, OpenBooks has expanded into one of Neocities' most popular sites, featuring a search engine and a hand-curated directory of the best Neocities sites. With OpenBooks 5, the site was scaled back and became much more focused, polished, and its purpose was made clear.</p>
