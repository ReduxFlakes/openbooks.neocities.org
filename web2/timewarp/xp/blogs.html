					<h1>OpenBooks XP</h1>
					<p class="subtitle">January 7 2018</p>
					<p>I'm proud to announce the biggest update to OpenBooks yet. Last month, the Network Neighborhood and I went open source on Github, and now work on OpenBooks since has steadily continued due to a sudden, large amount of free time ;). OpenBooks 2.5 contains more changes than any other update I've published so far, and a new overall visual style. Be sure to check the update notes! More soon to come...</p>

					<h1>OpenBooks 2.1</h1>
					<p class="subtitle">November 5 2015</p>
					<p>After a bit of a delay, OpenBooks 2.1 is here. 2.1 marks the first major update to OpenBooks since the rebuild. This one was mostly visual changes. Usually, visual changes would only warrent a minor update, but because there were so many, we got a larger version bump. Not all of the features I had planned made it into the update, but a few did. One of those is Articles. OpenBooks Articles has now entered beta, and articles can be submitted to my email address. I'll also be publishing my own soon. </p>
					<p>Future plans: 2.2 will include the Directory and Gallery, both features I originally intended for 2.1. 2.1 needed to be released because I meant for the visual changes to occur weeks ago, but school comes first and I haven't had the time. Luckily though, I now have a bit more time to devote to OpenBooks and should be able to keep up a consistent release schedule. Fun fact: I have more planned than just this website.</p>

					<h1>OpenBooks 2.0 Released</h1>
					<p class="subtitle">October 9 2015</p>
					<p>OpenBooks has been completely redesigned and rebuilt. I couldn't be happier with it. But as always, there's still much to do.</p>
					<h2>So what's next?</h2>
					<p>I need to make some adjustments for the website to work better in Internet Explorer (it doesn't display colors properly) and I want to finish the Directory and Gallery. Right now, I don't have much to add to them. Within the next few weeks, we should reach ChromeBooks 2.1 which will take us out of beta.</p>
