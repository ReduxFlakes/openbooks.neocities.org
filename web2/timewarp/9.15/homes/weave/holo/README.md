# holo

Module-based CSS template for responsive web design.

I created Weave.css so I wasn't writing the same code every time I made a new website. Weave.css has evolved and become Holo, a modular CSS template for modern web design.

Holo is configured with CSS variables, and you only have to load the components you intend to use - there's no reason to load an entire framework is you're only using a few parts of it.

Holo is designed to be built on top of, which can be done by modifying it directly or by writing your own Holo modules.
