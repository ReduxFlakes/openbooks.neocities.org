					<p>I’m not angry. I’m not upset. I’m just hurt. It hurts when you say rude things about me online. Saying I’ve been nasty to you specifically simply isn’t true. You can even ask other people I regularly interact with. After 4+ years of knowing you, I thought you had gotten used to it. Most people don’t though. That’s something I’ve gotten used to.</p>
          <p>
           
	For those who aren’t BSO and aren’t aware: I have a personality disorder that causes me to be, for lack of a better word, a bit of an asshole. I tend to be very blunt. Basically, there is a limit to the range of emotions I can regularly express, and being empathetic just isn’t one of them, which can make me seem cold, uncaring, and well, a bitch. 
          </p>
          <p>
	I never intended for anything to seem like it was just you. I tend to be that way with anyone. I try very hard not to, but in casual settings like text chat, I may say or send things without really thinking about it. It’s just not part of my nature. 
          </p><p>
	Also, you weren’t the only one who didn’t care about some of the conversation, as I too had expressed my disinterest, multiple times. However, it’s your choice to participate, and if a topic, such as TF2, doesn’t interest you, you don’t have to talk about it. 
  </p>
  <p>
	I understand why you would want to leave the group. We didn’t ask you about it afterwards, because honestly, it didn’t seem like you wanted to be. And the reason was quite clear.
	We aren’t going to try to come up with reasons for you to come back. Leaving was your decision, and we’re going to respect that you left for your own reasons. We wouldn’t want to push someone into joining something they aren’t interested in anymore. You did ask me to join in the first place. </p>

	<p>I strongly believe you do have a place. And I’m sorry that the Network Neighborhood wasn’t yours.</p>
