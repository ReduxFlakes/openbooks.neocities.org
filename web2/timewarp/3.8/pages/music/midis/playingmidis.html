  <h1>Playing Midis</h1>
  <p>Midi files can be played in Windows Media Player on your computer (or QuickTime) but I find that the default synthesizer is sub-par. WinAmp and foobar2000 allow you to use your soundcard's synth, but there's an even better option. MidiPlayer2 is a free application for Windows that allows you to use a SoundFont to customize the synthesizer. Midis have a reputation for sounding bad, but that's only because most people play them straight through WMP. They are actually capable of rather sophisicated synthesis if played using the right tools.</p>
  <p>You can find a download link for MidiPlayer2 on the Downloads page.</p>
