coyote's list of ideas:

rewrite home page *in progress, probably openbooks 9.0 or probably not. maybe it's 8 forever.

switch to ungrid instead of avalananche? *might not actually work as well for mobile responsiveness?
                                         Research more - try swapping for home page rewrite
                                         ungrid doesn't do the cool autofill, so not great for the choosers,
                                         but ok otherwise. can do percentage / pixel widths inline

openbooks homes - even if it's not public its microsites for me to use

fork element to weave CSS, which is a more full-featured version of element

separate pages for collections pages

different design for coyote's home (wait for openbooks 9)

switch license (MIT?)
